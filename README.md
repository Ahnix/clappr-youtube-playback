# clappr-youtube-playback
Clappr plugin for playing youtube based videos

It uses the [YouTube iframe API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) for managing the YouTube content.

Don't use this plugin unless you are sure the source you are trying to load is actually from YouTube.
